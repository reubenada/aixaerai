                            <p> Edit: Netflix description - A Japanese death cult is ordered to aid in the spiritual destruction of China. Their method: abduct their enemies' children and train them as killers. So I've been waiting for UPS to drop off an air soft gun I ordered and hopped on Netflix to pass the time. I wanted something totally random and rarely use Netflix. Little did I know there was a foreign film section and the thumbnail of two buff Japanese dudes looking to kick some ass caught my attention. No spoilers. Yesterday I was settling down on the couch to watch TV with the wife, when she picks this movie from Netflix. I think I'd seen it in passing, but didn't pay any attention to it. Well, I'm glad she did, because we both loved the action in this one. I don't want to give any spoilers, but I'll say the story is kind of convoluted. On netflix there were points where the subtitles were either off or too fast to see exactly what was said, but you get the picture for the most part. Xing Yu pretty. Pulled together a list of the movies available for free on YouTube (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9xw7b2/ ), along with their Rotten Tomatoes critic and audience scores. Combined score is an average of the critic score (if available), and the audience score adjusted for the number of ratings using the SteamDB Rating (https://steamdb.info/blog/steamdb-rating/) equation. Daily reminder that the RT score is the percentage of critics that gave a positive review, not the average critic. #### New Releases (Blu-ray) American Hustle (2013) ( Barricade (2012) ( Frozen (2013) ( Here Comes the Devil (2012) ( Kill Your Darlings (2013) ( Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom (2013) ( Outpost: Rise of the Spetsnaz.

I've lately become obsessed with Kung Fu movies and have been watching them on Netflix nonstop. Post your favorite Kung Fu movies from Netflix Ill Start The Wrath Of Vajra was a movie I enjoyed watching, a mysterious movie about a Japanese cult revolved around fighting to the death and breeding warriors. It's been a little hit or miss on the kungfu front as far as quality releases go: Jackie Chan did ok with CZ13 but then flopped with Police Story 2013, Tony Jaa's Tom-Yum-Goong 2 failed to live up to the original and the US release of The Grandmaster has been thoroughly butchered. So I was very surprised when OUATIS ( came out of nowhere and blew me away; starring Sammo Hung, Andy On and Phillip Ng with fight coreography My Current Thoughts on Tier 6 starting gear for Death Knights. This is a work in progress, frequent changes will be edited in as I learn more. Target: Tier 6 maps Priorities: 1 Combined damage (Physical+Magic), 2 Action Points (for more true damage twilight strikes), and 3 Accuracy (DK's struggle with this stat). Priorities in that order. Crit, while valuable is not a priority. Items with an star ★ are items of higher confidence as to their usefulness against the targets mentioned.

Augus was a bold warrior in all aspects of his view on life. He valued. When Asura ( from Asura's Wrath gets brought up in battle threads people sometimes focus on what happened in the "true" ending of the events of his game ( which has a battle that makes Asura seem very powerful in some ways, perhaps more powerful than he actually is and this is often due to several misconceptions This post will be using scans from the game guide (https://s.pacn.ws/1500/c6/pa.219291.2.jpg?o3b. > "I understand it all now!

Asura (https://imgur.com/a/01fGT) is a hot-tempered and stubborn demi-god by nature and is known for charging head on at the enemy without a second.
